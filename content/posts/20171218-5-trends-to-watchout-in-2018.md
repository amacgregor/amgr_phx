With 2018 around the corner is prudent to take some time and see what new and existing trends will dominate 2018.

## Blockchain

> In 2017 we saw many of the Silicon Valley giants experiment or even introducing their own blockchain implementations, IBM been the most significant one by collaborating with food distributors, government regulation agencies and banks for leveraging blockchain.

#### Why it matters

With applications ranging from cryptocurrency, to smart properties, to identity like passports; we have only started scratching the surface of what Blockchain technology can offer and in 2018 it won't be a surprise if we see a rise in the creation and adoption of blockchain based application.

In fact, in 2017 Amazon, Oracle, Microsoft and IBM all started experimenting and working on their own blockchain platforms, and in 2018 we will see more companies joining the bandwagon across a myriad of different fields.

## AI will take over ...

> ... but not in the way you think. In 2018 we will see a raise in solutions and applications augmented by the use Machine Learning/AI.

For many AI seems to be an all or nothing proposition, the reality is that AI is already here and contributing in unexpected ways. In 2018 we will see the transition from AI being somewhat of a buzzword and a nice to have, to an absolute necessity for startups and businesses.

## The Rise of Backends As A Service (BaaS)

> Backend as a service, while typically is not reference by that name is a trend that has been on the rise in 2017 and will continue gaining steam during 2018.

#### Why it matters

BaaS turns traditional parts of the backend into a third party service that is consumed by other applications, some good examples of BaaS are push notifications, file storage and sharing, integration with social networks and messaging and chat, just to mention a few.

One trend that I'm expecting to see more of in 2018 is what Shopify is doing with its Storefront API, in which Shopify essentially becomes a headless backend for a fully customizable shopping experience.
