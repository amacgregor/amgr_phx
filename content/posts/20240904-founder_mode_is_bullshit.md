<!-- A criticism and rebutal of Paul Graham's latest essay called founder mode -->

In a recent article discussing leadership in the tech world, the argument is made that founders should adopt a distinct “founder mode” instead of transitioning into “manager mode” as their companies scale. This concept has gained traction, especially in Silicon Valley, where founders are often portrayed as visionaries and company saviors, while managers are relegated to mere operators. The argument suggests that founders who listen to advice on delegating and managing are actually harming their companies, and they should instead cling to the hands-on approach that brought them success in the early days.

While this might sound appealing, especially to those who romanticize the founder narrative, it’s ultimately a deeply flawed perspective. The dichotomy it creates between "founder mode" and "manager mode" is an oversimplification of leadership. Worse, it promotes a harmful myth that founders alone hold the key to a company’s success, ignoring the role that skilled managers and collaborative teams play in sustainable growth. In reality, adopting a singular leadership approach—whether founder-driven or manager-focused—is not only misleading but detrimental to the health of a company. Let’s break down why this “founder mode” idea is not the savior it’s being made out to be.

## The False Dichotomy of Founder Mode vs Manager Mode

The notion that founders must choose between being a "founder" or a "manager" is a false dichotomy. Leadership is not a binary choice but a spectrum that requires a blend of various skills and approaches. Founders who succeed in scaling their companies do so not by adhering strictly to a "founder mode," but by evolving their leadership style to meet the changing needs of their organization.

The idea of "founder mode" often conjures up images of a leader who is deeply involved in every aspect of the business, from product development to customer service. While this hands-on approach can be beneficial in the early stages of a startup, it becomes unsustainable as the company grows. A founder who tries to maintain this level of control is likely to become a bottleneck, slowing down decision-making and stifling the autonomy and development of their team.

On the other hand, "manager mode" is often associated with a more hands-off leadership style, focused on delegation and strategic planning. While these are crucial skills for any leader, they are not the sole province of managers. Founders must also learn to delegate effectively and think strategically if they are to guide their companies through growth and change.

The key to successful leadership is not choosing between "founder mode" and "manager mode," but rather understanding when and how to combine the best elements of both. This means being willing to get your hands dirty when necessary, but also knowing when to step back and empower others to take the lead. It involves setting a clear vision for the company while also being open to feedback and collaboration.

In conclusion, the "founder mode" vs "manager mode" debate is a distraction from the real challenge of leadership: navigating the complex, ever-changing demands of a growing company. Founders who recognize this will be better equipped to build organizations that are not only successful in the short term but also sustainable in the long run.
