The past two years have been a blur, and before I realized it, more than two years have passed since I posted anything to this blog; however, that doesn't mean I haven't been writing or busy at all during that time.

I have been writing quite a bit, just not for this blog; one of the main avenues for writing has been working with the fantastic team at [Draft](https://draft.dev) and I recently started working with the team at  [AppSignal](https://appsignal.com), and I have been enjoying that as well.

You can keep track of the articles that have gone live on my [Publications](https://allanmacgregor.com/publications) list.

## What's Next?

There are a few things that I want to do with this blog, and I am going to try to do them in the next few months; one of the things I want to do is to start writing more about Elixir and Flow-based programming, and I have a few ideas in that space that I want to explore further.

Additionally, there are several projects that I have been working on and off that I'm hoping to get back and focus more on in 2023.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allanmacgregor) to keep up with what I'm working on and any updates to the blog.
