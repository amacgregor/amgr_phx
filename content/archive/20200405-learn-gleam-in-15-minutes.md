<!--Gleam is a statically typed language for the Erlang VM that shows considerable promise-->

## What is Gleam

**Gleam** is a statically typed functional programming language for building scalable concurrent systems. It compiles to Erlang, meaning that has straightforward interoperability with other **BEAM** languages like Erlang and Elixir.

**Gleam** is governed by the following principles:

- **Be Safe:** Gleam's type system helps developers find bugs at compile time, way before it reaches the user.
- **Be Friendly:** The compiler should be as clear and helpful as possible.
- **Be Performant:** Gleam aims to be as fast, scalable and performant as other BEAM languages.
- **Be a Good Citizen:** Gleam makes it easy to use libraries from other BEAM languages like Erlang and Elixir and vice-versa
