# AI Writing Patterns: The Complete Reference

*What makes AI-generated content detectable â€” and how to avoid it*

---

## The Core Problem

Research shows that different AI systems leave distinct "stylistic fingerprints" that can be identified with **97-99% accuracy**. These patterns persist even after rewriting, translation, or summarization. More importantly, readers increasingly *feel* when something is AI-generated, even if they can't articulate why.

This isn't just about detection tools. It's about authenticity. AI patterns make content feel generic, forgettable, and interchangeable with a million other pieces.

## PART 3: STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

### The Classic AI Essay Structure
1. **Opening hook** that telegraphs what's coming
2. **Thesis statement** with numbered points ("three key areas")
3. **Body sections** of nearly identical length
4. **Each paragraph** follows topic sentence â†’ support â†’ transition
5. **Long conclusion** that restates everything already said

### Sentence-Level Patterns

**Uniform sentence length**
- AI tends to write sentences of 12-18 words consistently
- Human writing has much more variation (5 words to 40 words)

**Low "burstiness"**
- AI maintains consistent rhythm throughout
- Humans mix short punchy lines with complex multi-clause sentences

**Predictable subject-verb distance**
- AI keeps subjects and verbs 2-3 words apart consistently
- Humans vary this naturally (sometimes 5+ words apart)

**Semicolon overuse**
- AI loves connecting simple statements with semicolons
- "The algorithm processes data; it generates output; results are analyzed."

**Correlative constructions**
- "Whether...or"
- "On the one hand...on the other hand"
- "Not only...but also"
- Repeated use creates mechanical rhythm

### Paragraph-Level Patterns

**Identical paragraph lengths**
- AI produces paragraphs of similar word counts
- Human writing has varied paragraph lengths

**List-like structures mid-essay**
- Bullet points appearing in formal writing
- Numbered lists where prose would be natural

**Excessive "signposting"**
- Telling the reader what you're about to say
- Announcing transitions explicitly
- "Now let's move on to..."
- "Having covered X, we can now examine Y..."

### Document-Level Patterns

**Too-neat organization**
- Every section wraps up cleanly before moving on
- Ideas don't bleed into each other
- No tangents or digressions
- Perfect symmetry/balance between sections

**Predictable arc**
- Introduction â†’ Background â†’ Analysis â†’ Conclusion
- No surprises in structure
- Every thread tied up neatly

## PART 4: STYLISTIC TELLS

### Tone Issues

**Emotional flatness**
- AI avoids strong opinions unless prompted
- Default neutral, polished, "helpful" tone
- Lacks personality quirks
- No genuine irritation, enthusiasm, or uncertainty

**Excessive formality**
- Uses "utilize" instead of "use"
- Avoids contractions unnecessarily
- Academic register where conversational would fit

**Performative hedging**
- "It could be argued that..."
- "Some might say..."
- "There are various perspectives on..."

### Content Issues

**Generic examples**
- Uses obvious, safe examples
- Lacks specific, unusual, or personal illustrations
- References well-known cases everyone uses

**Missing lived experience**
- No "I was wrong about this"
- No "this happened to me"
- No specific details only an insider would know

**Vague depth**
- Sounds comprehensive but lacks specifics
- "A deeper understanding of..." (followed by surface-level content)
- Claims insight without demonstrating it

**Excessive hedging**
- Every claim qualified
- Never takes a firm position
- "Generally speaking..." / "In many cases..."

### The "Performative Authenticity" Problem

Recent AI has learned to *sound* human by adding:
- Short fragment sentences. Like this. For emphasis.
- Rhetorical questions. You know what I mean?
- Self-aware meta-commentary
- Artificial "vulnerability"

But these become patterns themselves:
```
No fluff. Not a rant. A reflection. Not chaos. Clarity.
Short sentences. Pauses for weight. You feel it.
Here's the key takeaway: [generic insight].
Curious what others think.
```

## PART 5: WHY DETECTION WORKS

### Perplexity
How "surprising" or unpredictable word choices are.
- AI: Low perplexity (chooses statistically "safe" next words)
- Humans: Higher perplexity (unexpected phrasing, unusual word choices)

### Burstiness
Variation in sentence length and structure.
- AI: Uniform rhythm throughout
- Humans: Mix of short/long, simple/complex

### Next-Token Prediction Bias
AI models trained to predict "most likely next word" based on training data.
- "In this article, we'll..." â†’ almost always followed by "explore," "delve into," or "discuss"
- This creates detectable patterns

## PART 6: HOW TO BREAK THE PATTERNS

### Word-Level Fixes
1. **Cut the dead giveaway words entirely** (delve, crucial, moreover, leverage)
2. **Use simpler alternatives** (utilize â†’ use, facilitate â†’ help)
3. **Vary your vocabulary** within the same piece
4. **Use contractions** where natural
5. **Include colloquialisms** appropriate to your voice

### Sentence-Level Fixes
1. **Vary sentence length dramatically** (some 5 words, some 30+)
2. **Use fragments intentionally** for impact
3. **Break expected structures** with parenthetical asides
4. **Eliminate semicolons** connecting simple statements
5. **Add rhetorical questions that aren't formulaic**

### Structure-Level Fixes
1. **Don't telegraph** what's coming
2. **Let some ideas remain unresolved**
3. **Include relevant tangents** that circle back
4. **Vary paragraph lengths** significantly
5. **Avoid perfect symmetry** between sections
6. **Skip the restating-everything conclusion**

### Content-Level Fixes
1. **Add specific personal experience** (not generic "I've seen...")
2. **Take actual positions** (not "some say X, others say Y")
3. **Include details only you would know**
4. **Allow genuine uncertainty** where it exists
5. **Reference specific companies, dates, numbers**
6. **Show your thinking process**, including dead ends

### The Real Test
Read it out loud. If it sounds like something you'd actually say in conversation, it's probably fine. If it sounds like a corporate memo or Wikipedia article, rewrite it.
