# Allan MacGregor Voice DNA Analysis

Based on the provided writing samples, here's the extracted voice DNA:

## 1. Sentence Structure Patterns

**Heavy semicolon usage for connecting related ideas:**
- "Cowboy is a small, fast, and modern HTTP server for Erlang/OTP; it particularly shines when handling multiple concurrent connections with minimal overhead."
- "In April 2025, Duolingo's CEO Luis von Ahn did something that most tech executives do every dayâ€”he talked about AI."

**Em-dash for elaboration and emphasis:**
- "Cowboy shines when... you're building focused servicesâ€”e.g., streaming telemetry or real-time feeds"
- "The backlash was so severe that the company wiped its social media accounts entirely."

**Varied sentence length creating rhythm:**
- Short punchy: "This one didn't disappear. It exploded."
- Medium explanatory: "Phoenix is the go-to web framework in Elixir, but sometimes you don't need the full stack."
- Long with multiple clauses: "If 2023 was the year of AI's awakening and 2024 the year of frantic adoption, then 2025 will be remembered as the year of the reckoning."

**Colon usage for explanation:**
- "Here's the thing: von Ahn wasn't saying anything that dozens of other CEOs hadn't already said."
- "The pattern is clear: when consumers can tell AI was involved, many of them don't like it."

## 2. Vocabulary Preferences

**Accessible technical language:**
- Prefers "set up" over "configure"
- Uses "tiny" instead of "minimal"
- Says "shines" rather than "excels"

**Conversational qualifiers:**
- "more often than not"
- "that being said"
- "honestly"
- "frankly"

**Direct, concrete verbs:**
- "exploded" (not "escalated")
- "flooded" (not "inundated")
- "pulled" (not "withdrew")

**Avoids AI writing clichÃ©s:**
- Never uses "delve," "leverage," "unlock," "harness"
- Rarely uses "robust," "comprehensive," "pivotal"
- Doesn't say "in today's fast-paced world" or "it's important to note"

**Specific over vague:**
- "400,000 TikTok followers" (not "significant following")
- "95% of enterprise AI pilot programs" (not "most programs")
- "42% in 2025" (not "a substantial increase")

## 3. Rhetorical Devices

**Strategic repetition for emphasis:**
- "What Duolingo demonstrated is that you can trade long-term customer trust and brand reputation for short-term revenue and growthâ€”and the bill won't come due immediately."

**Rhetorical questions to engage:**
- "So why did Duolingo become the lightning rod?"
- "What would it look like to tell your employees, honestly, what AI means for their roles?"

**Numbered/structured lists for complex breakdowns:**
- Uses bullet points sparingly, only for actual lists
- Prefers prose explanation with inline structure

**Pattern-then-insight structure:**
- Presents multiple examples
- Then synthesizes: "The pattern is clear..."
- Follows with interpretation

**Contrasts and juxtapositions:**
- "Deployment is buying the tool. Adoption is everything that happens after."
- "They're anti-thoughtlessness."

## 4. Tone and Formality Level

**Formality: Conversational Professional (6/10)**
- Uses contractions naturally: "you'll," "don't," "isn't," "we've"
- Direct address: "If you're building a fintech product..."
- But maintains technical credibility

**Confidence without arrogance:**
- "I believe we will see in 2026..."
- "In my opinion, the AI backlash isn't really about AI at all."
- "I'd push back on that interpretation."

**Honest about uncertainty:**
- "honestly, it's worse than most people realize"
- "I'm not going to give you a checklistâ€”you've seen enough of those"

**Balanced skepticism:**
- Presents data first
- Then offers interpretation
- Acknowledges counterarguments

**Peer-to-peer positioning:**
- Writes like a colleague, not a consultant
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's take a look at..."

## 5. Unique Quirks and Signatures

**The "Here's the thing" pivot:**
- Used to introduce contrarian or clarifying points
- "Here's the thing: von Ahn wasn't saying anything..."
- Signals a shift to deeper insight

**Statistical density without statistical tone:**
- Cites numbers frequently but integrates them naturally
- "A July 2025 MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilot programs deliver no measurable impact..."
- Numbers support narrative, don't drive it

**"Let that sink in" moment:**
- Creates pause after significant statistics
- "Let that sink in for a second."

**Counterintuitive framing:**
- "The irony?"
- "Here's what's particularly interesting..."
- Sets up unexpected insights

**Code-first, then explanation pattern:**
- Shows code block
- Explains what it does
- Breaks down why it matters
- Clear teaching structure

**Acknowledges reader knowledge:**
- "For those unfamiliar with Gartner's framework..."
- "Chances are that if you are an engineer actively interviewing..."
- Respects audience while filling gaps

**Personal experience grounding:**
- "I've been watching this space closely..."
- "In my experience there is still a lot of fumbling..."
- Uses "I" naturally without ego

**Meta-commentary on writing choices:**
- "I'm not going to give you a checklist"
- "Let's start by unpacking the term"
- Transparent about approach

**"That being said" as transition:**
- Used to acknowledge one perspective before presenting another
- Creates nuance without dismissal

**Question-section structure:**
- In analysis pieces, uses questions as section headers
- "Are You Solving a Problem or Chasing a Technology?"
- Invites reflection rather than prescribing

**Practical, not preachy:**
- Avoids "you should" language
- Instead: "Here are the questions I think technical leaders should be sitting with..."

**Footnote-style interjections:**
- Uses bold text with asterisks for emphasis: "**What Duolingo demonstrated is that..."
- Creates visual and conceptual emphasis

## Voice Signature Summary

Allan's voice is **conversationally technical**â€”he sounds like the colleague who explains complex topics over coffee, not the consultant who presents from slides. He:

- **Structures complexity** through varied sentence length and strategic punctuation
- **Grounds abstraction** in concrete data and specific examples
- **Challenges assumptions** while remaining curious rather than combative
- **Teaches without lecturing** through questions and peer-to-peer positioning
- **Values precision** in language without sacrificing accessibility
- **Maintains skepticism** balanced with honest enthusiasm where warranted

The closest analog: Paul Graham's essays meet technical documentation, filtered through someone who's done the work, not just theorized about it.
