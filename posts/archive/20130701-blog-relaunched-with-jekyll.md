Over the last 2 years I have tried several times to kickstart **coderoncode.com**, and a long with it I have tried multiple
blogging platforms (wordpress, obtvse, etc) I even tried coding my own blogging solution; all without much success.

From each of these attempts I have learned valueable lessons, so far I have spent more time tweaking the platform and the style
than actually writing; so if I'm to succeed this time I need a blogging platform that actually lets me write and doesn't get
in the way.

## Meet Jekyll

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various
> formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website
> suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

As content generators go, Jekyll is truly amazing, while I don't (yet) intent to list the full set of features or how to use it
we can over the main features of **Jekyll**

- Clear directory structure and scaffolding generation.
- Support for assets and downloads.
- Preview server.
- Configurable in YAML.
- Supports drafts and future publications dates.
