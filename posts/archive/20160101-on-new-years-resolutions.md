Another year came and went, and as we do every year we are expected setup new resolutions and new goals for the upcoming year. It's the usual thing to do that society expects of every single one of us.

I can almost hear family and coworkers asking — So, Any new year resolutions?— And like every year I'm tempted to answer yes and list some of the many things on my ever-growing todo list:

- Learn guitar
- Finish that book I been working on for months
- Do more exercises
- etc. etc. etc

But this year I'm done deluding myself and setting up goals that I know I won't follow, my only resolution for 2016 is simple:

<h2><strong>Be Happy</strong></h2>

Being happy means I will spend more time on the things that bring me joy and happiness and less worrying and suffering on doing things I don't like; it's as simple as that, do more of what I like and less of what I dislike.

On _2016_ what will you do to be happy?
